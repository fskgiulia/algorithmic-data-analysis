## Datasets

*iris* from <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris>
The files `iris-SV-sepal.csv` and `iris-VV-length.csv` contain variants of the dataset from the UCI data repository, as used in the lecture.
The file `iris-SV-sepal.csv` contains only attributes `sepal_length` and `sepal_width` for instances of the classes `Iris-setosa` and `Iris-versicolor`. It is a two-dimensional dataset for binary classification, where the two classes are linearly separable.
The file `iris-VV-length.csv` contains only attributes `sepal_length` and `petal_length` for instances of the classes `Iris-virginica` and `Iris-versicolor`. It is a two-dimensional dataset for binary classification, where the two classes are not linearly separable.
