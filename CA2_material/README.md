## Idea
Implementation of the generalized sequential pattern mining (GSP) algorithm for mining frequent patterns
from discrete sequences and test of the algorithm on the CRSW dataset.

## Dataset
CRSW originally from https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations#!/, 2019-01-03_itemsets-CRSW.txt contains two months worth of weather data in Kuopio (Januaryâ€“February 2019). Each line represents weather events during one hour as an itemset. The first column contains the contextual attribute, i.e. indication of time in Year-Month-Day_Hour format. The second column contains the itemset. C, R S and W stand respectively for clouds, precipitation, sunshine and wind.
